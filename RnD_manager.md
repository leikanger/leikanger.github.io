# Per R. Leikanger -- Chief Autonomy Officer 
Our CAO is the lead architect of the neoRL system for real-time interaction learning, 
	and responsible for managing our R&D contacts and partners.
If you have an innovative R&D project, please contact our CAO for a first interview and consideration of how se can help.

Please reach out per [email](mailto:leikange@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/per-leikanger),
	or per telephone **400 40 814** for arranging our first meeting.

### 2024 - --->  --- CAO @ neoRL.net
  Chief Autonomy Officer for neoRL.net, with prime responsibility for our autonomy stack and neoRL R&D sevices. 
  Comprehensive experience on project development on digitalization and autonomous techenology. 
  Great records for sequring soft funding for Hyke, NORCE and internal neoRL projects.

### 2023 - 2024  --- Head of R&D @ Hydrolift Smart City Ferries AS
  Project manager for Hyke R&D projects and personally responsible for more than 20MNOK soft funding to Hyke --
  Hydrolift Smart City Ferries AS. Per is still involved with Hyke through neoRL.net as hired project manager and lead
  programmer for digitalization projects and for adaptive and autonomous navigation.

### 2017 - 2022  --- PhD: __Autonomous Navigation by (the animal and) the machine.__
  A deep investigation in the discrepancies between digital "autonomy" and biological agents for autonomous navigation
  uncovered how genuine autonomy is plausible via distributed approaches to RL. 
  Purposive networks, where desires formed based on experience can be used as setpoints for other neoRL modules,
  allows for genuine category II autonomous navigation. 
  The AI equivalent to neobehaviorism and Tolman's purposive behaviorism.
  
  First half of 2020: Academic visitor with Richard Sutton at RLAI lab @ UoA.
  
### 2012 - 2016  --- R&D Engineer in the industry
  - 2012 -- R&D Engineer, Ultrasound Imaging, Archer -- the Well Company
  - 2014 -- Senior Software Developer, Integrated Bridge, Rolls-Royce Maritime  
  - 2015 -- Head of R&D, Signal Processing, Breivoll Inspection Technologies
  
### 2012 --- Engineering Cybernetics: Biomedical Robotics, NTNU 
  Master's degree at Norwegian University of Technology and Science (NTNU).  
  "Development and assessment of a novel model for artificial neural networks":
  MSc thesis in engineering cybernetics.
    
### 2011 --- Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience/ Biology of Memory, NTNU
  In 2011 I had the pleasure of studying under May-Britt and Edvard Moser, years 
  before the Mosers shared the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine with John O'Keefe.  
  This was done on the side of completing my MSc degree in Engineering Cybernetics.
