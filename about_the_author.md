# Per R. Leikanger

My primary aim is to understand learning and autonmy to a level by which an autonomous agent can be implemented.

##### 2011 -- Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience/ Biology of Memory, NTNU
  In 2011 I had the pleasure of studying under May-Britt and Edvard Moser, 3 years 
  before members of the lab shared the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine with John O'Keefe.  
  This was done in parallel with completing my MSc degree in Engineering Cybernetics.
  
##### 2012 -- Engineering Cybernetics: Biomedical Robotics, NTNU 
  Master's degree at Norwegian University of Technology and Science (NTNU).  
  "Development and assessment of a novel model for artificial neural networks":
  MSc thesis in engineering cybernetics
  development and assessment of a novel model for the signalling properties of the neuron.  
    
##### 2012 -- 2016   R&D Engineer in the industry
  - 2012 -- R&D Engineer, Ultrasound Imaging, Archer -- the Well Company
  - 2014 -- Senior Software Developer, Integrated Bridge, Rolls-Royce Maritime  
  - 2015 -- Head of R&D, Signal Processing, Breivoll Inspection Technologies
  
##### 2017 -- 2021 PhD Candidate: __Autonomous Navigation by (the animal and) the machine.__
  With the initial goal of autonomous ships learning navigation by reactive
  reinforcement learning, I soon found it necessary to do foundational RL
  research instead of maritime technology.
  Combining theory from engineering cybernetics and what I learned at the Kavli
  institute for systems neuroscience, my approach is distrbuted.
