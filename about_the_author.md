# Per R. Leikanger

Autonomous researcher on autonomous navigation. 
My primary aim is to understand learning and autonmy to a level by which an autonomous agent can be implemented.
I do this in the intersection between computational neuroscience and behavioral AI, 
    combining modern results on the neuroscience of navigation and psychology of learning with modern reinforcement learning in AI.
See my [articles](index.md) for how this is possible.


I can also be reached per [email](per.leikanger@uit.no) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/per-leikanger).

##### 2011 --- Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience/ Biology of Memory, NTNU
  In 2011 I had the pleasure of studying under May-Britt and Edvard Moser, years 
  before the Mosers shared the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine with John O'Keefe.  
  This was done on the side of completing my MSc degree in Engineering Cybernetics.
  
##### 2012 --- Engineering Cybernetics: Biomedical Robotics, NTNU 
  Master's degree at Norwegian University of Technology and Science (NTNU).  
  "Development and assessment of a novel model for artificial neural networks":
  MSc thesis in engineering cybernetics
  development and assessment of a novel model for the signalling properties of the neuron.  
    
##### 2012 - 2016  --- R&D Engineer in the industry
  - 2012 -- R&D Engineer, Ultrasound Imaging, Archer -- the Well Company
  - 2014 -- Senior Software Developer, Integrated Bridge, Rolls-Royce Maritime  
  - 2015 -- Head of R&D, Signal Processing, Breivoll Inspection Technologies
  
##### 2017 - 2022  --- PhD Candidate: __Autonomous Navigation by (the animal and) the machine.__
  A deep investigation in the discrepancies between digital "autonomy" and biological agents for autonomous navigation
  uncovered how genuine autonomy is plausible via distributed approaches to RL. 
  Purposive networks, where desires formed based on experience can be used as setpoints for other neoRL modules,
  allows for genuine category II autonomous navigation. 
  The AI equivalent to neobehaviorism and Tolman's purposive behaviorism.
  
  First half of 2020: Academic visitor with Richard Sutton at RLAI lab @ UoA.
