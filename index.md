# The neoRL network for autonomy 

The neoRL approach to navigational autonomy is based on state representation in the mammalian brain, 
exploring how neural representation of Euclidean space (NRES) could establish learning capabilities needed for online autonomous navigation in technology.
The basic idea of decomposing the prediction problem for RL is presented in 
[Decomposing the Prediction Problem](https://ar5iv.org/html/2106.15868), demonstrating how NRES-oriented RL (neoRL) can make autonomous navigation plausible in technology.

Modern cognitive neuroscience further considers reasoning and intelligence as a navigational challenge, 
with experimental results indicating that ideas and concepts can be viewed as locations and vectors in conceptual space.
In my second [article](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2202.09646), presented at the Conference series in Artificial General Intelligence, 
the neoRL agent is challenged based on Leslie Kaelbling's opinion piece in [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaz7597) (2020).
The neoRL framework is general across parameter spaces, efficient enough for real-time autonomy, and incremental and compositional for additional spaces,
    allowing for multi-modal navigation by neoRL agents.

Finally, scheduled for presentation at the conference on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making 2022, the neoRL framework is demonstrated for category II autonomy.
Networks of neoRL nodes are demonstrated for neoRL nodes capable of latent learning, capable of forming autonomous desires based on experienced inferences.
The unreasonable efficiency of recurrent purposive neoRL networks is demonstrated under ``[demonstrations](demonstrations.md)'',
an effect that is explored further in the [contribution](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2202.12622) to RLDM-2022.

## Public defense
The neoRL framework is a result of a five year long research project; my PhD project is planned for public online defense, early June.
Time and link for the public online event will be announced here, medio May.

[TBA] The public defense will be accessible for everybody on *June 3, at noon (GMT+1)*. Link to the stream will appear here once desided.
