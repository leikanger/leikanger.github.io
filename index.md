# The neoRL network for autonomy 

The neoRL approach to navigational autonomy is based on state representation in the mammalian brain, 
exploring how neural representation of Euclidean space (NRES) could establish learning capabilities needed for online autonomous navigation in technology.
The basic idea of decomposing the prediction problem for RL is presented in 
[Decomposing the Prediction Problem](https://ar5iv.org/html/2106.15868), demonstrating how NRES-oriented RL (neoRL) can make autonomous navigation plausible in technology.

Mondern cognitive neuroscience sees reasoning and intelligence as a navigational challenge in a cognitive space.
In my second [article](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2202.09646), presented at the Conference series in Artificial General Intelligence, 
    the neoRL agent is demonstrated to be general across parameter spaces, sufficiently efficient for real-time autonomy, and incremental and compositional in value space.

Scheduled for presentation at [RLDM 2022](https://www.rldm.org), the neoRL framework is demonstrated to be capable of category II autonomy.
Networks of neoRL nodes are demonstrated, where the output of one node is used as setpoint for another, demonstrating how this drastically improves navigational performance.
The unreasonable efficiency of recurrent purposive neoRL networks is demonstrated under ``[demonstrations](demonstrations.md)'',
an effect that is explored further in the [contribution](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2202.12622) to RLDM-2022.

## Public defense
The neoRL framework is a result of a five year long research project; my PhD project is planned for public online defense, early June.
Time and link for the public online event will be announced here, medio May.

[TBA] The public defense will be accessible for everybody on *June 3, at noon (GMT+1)*. Link to the stream will appear here once desided.
