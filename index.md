# The neoRL network for autonomy 

This page is intended as a repository of information regarding the neoRL project and autonomous navigation by NRES-oriented RL agents.
Publications and my thesis is available as arxive preprints, made available as html5 versions under 'publications'.

## Public defense
The neoRL framework is the result of an autonomous PhD; the thesis will soon be available on arxive, with a public online defence in june.

[TBA] The public defense will be accessible for everybody on *June 3, at noon (GMT+1)*. Link to the stream will appear here once desided.

## Real-time learning videos
Autonomous navigation happens in the allocentric [WaterWorld](https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/games/waterworld.html) environment (not the simpler egocentric javascript-version). 
Learning and execution happens in real-time in the following videos, with the agent being initiated at the beginning of the run (video) with no precursors other than what is described in the above article.
